## 🧠 Overview  

**Rebelle** is a digital art application built around the realistic simulation of traditional painting techniques. Instead of relying on artificial effects, it models how paint, water, and surfaces interact, delivering results that closely resemble physical media.

From flowing watercolors to dense oils and textured dry tools, every stroke responds to pressure, moisture, and surface grain. This creates a natural rhythm while painting and allows artists to work intuitively rather than mechanically.

Rebelle offers a balanced environment where classical painting principles meet the flexibility of modern digital workflows.
